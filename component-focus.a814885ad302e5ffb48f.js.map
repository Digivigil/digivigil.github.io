We are accomplishing this by refactoring the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, updating documentation, and creating unit tests. Our long-term goals are to create a thriving open-source community around these projects and to continue to create high-quality solutions that empower users.\n    </div>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <div class=\"MainInfoTitleDiv\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px; border: none; border-bottom: solid black 4px; text-align: left\">\n      Vision:\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"MainInfoDiv\">\n      Our vision is to create software that makes a positive impact on people's lives. We believe that software should be accessible, transparent, and easy to use. We want to empower users to create their own solutions and to contribute to the open-source community.
